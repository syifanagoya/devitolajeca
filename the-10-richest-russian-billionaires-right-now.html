It wouldn't shock us to learn that any of us who've written about Russian billionaires, and the general corruption in their ranks, have landed us on a watch list at the Kremlin. That said, it is time to look at a new list of the richest Russian billionaires. Many of them, of course, have ties to Russia's President <a href=#>Vladimir Putin</a>. Should those ties sour, however, they could find themselves on the wrong end of a poison, bullet, or some other "suspicious" form of death, even if they flee Russia to escape the wrath of Putin and the Kremlin. For now, these 10 men are good to go to keep running their businesses and building their fortunes. Only time and their actions will tell if they will find themselves on the wrong side of Putin's favors like…well any number of Russian billionaires who've met their death in very suspicious ways. And there are a lot of them. Without any further ado (or speculation into the mercurial nature of Putin or Russian society), these are the 10 richest Russian billionaires right now.</p><p><strong>#10. <a href=# title="Vagit Alekperov Net Worth">Vagit Alekperov</a>, $6.7 billion</strong></p><p>Source: Oil</p><p>Vagit Alekperov began working for the drilling company, Kaspmorneft, while still in school, and then became a full-time engineer for them after graduating. He was promoted from engineer to head of his own production unit over the course of the next few years. He then moved to Siberia to work for Surgutneftegaz, another oil company. There, he quickly established himself as an expert, and subsequently became the director, or deputy director, of a number of oil production companies. In the early 90s, the government came calling, and he became the Deputy Prime Minister of the Oil and Gas Industry of the Soviet Union. He was instrumental in the creation and implementation of Langepas-Uray-Kogalymneft, Russia's first vertically integrated state-owned oil/energy company. That company has since changed its name to LUKoil. He is the company's largest shareholder and its former President.</p><p><strong>#9.

The majority of his holdings are managed under the umbrella of his Volga Resources group. He also owns the engineering firm, Stroytransgaz, and the railway company, Transoil, which specializes in transporting oil products.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-300709 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GettyImages-127974488.jpg alt width=900 height=642 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-300709 class=wp-caption-text>Roman Abramovich (Photo credit: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images)</p><p><strong>#8. <a href=# title="Roman Abramovich Net Worth">Roman Abramovich</a>, $10 billion</strong></p><p>Source: Steel, Investments</p><p>Roman Abramovich is a citizen of Israel who has been living abroad in England for a very long time.
