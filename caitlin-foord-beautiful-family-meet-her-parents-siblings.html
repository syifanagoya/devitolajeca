Apparently, they have been the ones behind her success. In an interview, she revealed that she will never be able to pay her mother for all she has done for her.&nbsp;</strong><b></b></p><p>Having a family that is always supportive is indeed a rare gift and this time, Caitlin is the lucky one. Here’s all to know about her family.</p><h2><strong>Caitlin Foord was Raised by a Single Mother</strong></h2><p>Caitlin Foord once noted that without her mother’s support, she wouldn’t have achieved the level of success she has. Since her childhood days, it had always been her mother who cared and nurtured her as a single parent.</p><p>Caitlin’s mother, Simone revealed that raising her children alone was challenging in itself, and having to take her youngest daughter for training was a hard task. She would take her daughter on a 200 km round trip from their home in Wollongong to Sydney 3-4 times every week. However, she juggled between balancing the family needs and saving up for her daughter’s training and trips.</p><p>Simone recalled that her daughter had always been athletic from childhood and was engaged in different sports before settling for football and by the age of 13, she was with the U17s. Though it was difficult waving her goodbye every time at the airport, she soon got used to it.</p><p>Caitlin’s mother also revealed that her daughter’s career encouraged her<a href=# rel=noopener> friendship with Roxanne and Annette</a> who are also mothers of players. According to her, their relationship has been about football as well as building a support network for their daughters.</p><h2><strong>Caitlin Foord’s Father Abandoned them in 1997</strong></h2><p>Caitlin rarely talks about her father. As such, information about him is not known. What we garnerd however is that he abandoned his wife, Simone, and daughters Caitlin and Jamie in 1997 when the soccer player was only 3 years old. Caitlin may likely not remember what he looks like.</p><p>It’s not clear why he left the family however, she has been out of their lives since that time, and his whereabouts are not known.</p><p><strong>Read Also:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Who Are Jenna Ortega’s Parents Edward A. Ortega and Natalie Ortega?</a></strong></p><h2><strong>Caitlin Grew Up With Her Elder Sister, Jamie Foord</strong></h2><p>As hinted earlier, Caitlin Foord is not the only child of her parents. In fact, she is the youngest. She was raised alongside her older sister Jamie Foord who was born on April 9, 1993, and she is 30 years old at the moment. The sister grew up in Shellharbour, a suburb located in the Illawarra region of New South Wales, Australia.</p><p>The pair share a special bond and Jamie has on countless times declared that she’s very proud of her sister and considered her her best friend. She has also been very supportive of her sister’s career as a football player.</p><p>Not so much is known about Caitlin’s sister Jamie. Asides from being in the spotlight because of her sister, she once made headlines in 2021 for <a href=# rel=noopener>drinking while driving</a> and was fined for it.</p><p>Also, her social media page indicates that she is engaged to Ranae Philips. The pair have been very open about their lovelife and their social media page is filled with loved-up moments of them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikn6uysLTLrqqtZpOkunCvwKKrpaGeYrOwu9GdZJudkarBqrLUpWSfmZ2eubp5zJ6crWWYmr9uvMCrnKeso2LAqq7LoqWgq18%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./nic-cage-says-its-probably-true-that-he-was-never-paid-for-leaving-las-vegas.html>&#171;&nbsp;Nic Cage Says &amp;quot;It's Probably True&amp;quot; That He Was Never Paid For &amp;quot;Leaving Las Vegas&amp;quot;</a>
