He went on to continue his education at Stanford University, where he developed his interest in acting. Later, he transferred to Carnegie Mellon University to pursue his acting career. In 1972, he earned a degree in Bachelor of Fine Arts in drama.</span></p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p><span>Ted has tied the knot three times. In 1970, he got married to his first wife, actress Randall “Randy” Gosch but the couple later divorced in 1975.
